#Images instructions
Place all your images (png, jpg, and gif) here. You can make subdirectories to have EDM specific images. All images in other subdirectories will not be minified and copied.

##EDM specific images
These images have to be in a subdir with the same name as the jade file in **/src**. For example you should have a **dutch-standard**, **dutch-corp**, **english-corp**, **english-standard**, **french-corp** and **french-standard** subdirectory with the default jade files to have EDM specific images.
