#Images instructions
Place all your asset files that are not images here. You can make subdirectories to have EDM specific files. All files in other subdirectories will not be copied. This directory will be empty for most EDMs.

##EDM specific files
These files have to be in a subdir with the same name as the jade file in **/src**. For example you should have a **dutch-standard**, **dutch-corp**, **english-corp**, **english-standard**, **french-corp** and **french-standard** subdirectory with the default jade files to have EDM specific assets.
